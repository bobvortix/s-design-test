# Task 2

## Process

- Plain semantic HTML
- Considering using Schema.org e.g. `<time itemprop="datePublished" datetime="2016-01-13T12:00:40+0000">` but time limited.
- Omitted aria-roles as need some time to decide on these.
- Using HTML5 https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/links.html#link-type-author for author.
